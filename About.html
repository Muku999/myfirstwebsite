<p>The <b>sparrowhawk</b> is one of our smallest birds of prey, the male being somewhere between a blackbird and a collared dove in size.  <br>
The female is larger, up to the size of a feral pigeon. <b>Sparrowhawks</b> are excellent bird hunters, catching small species like finches, <br> sparrows and tits; sometimes they ambush their prey from a perch, while other times they may fly low, <br> suddenly changing direction to fool it.</p>
<p>The <b>sparrowhawk</b> has rounded wings and a relatively long, narrow tail. Males are small with a blue-grey back and white underparts showing reddish-orange barring. Females are much larger, with browner plumage above and grey bars below. They both have reddish cheeks.
